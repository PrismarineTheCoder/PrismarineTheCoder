- Hey. My name is PrismarineTheCoder, or PTC, but I'm Prism for short. I like to hack and code things, especially when it comes to games.
- I want to make a functional Minecraft SMP server for my friends, that is online 24/7.
- I'm learning how to code rapidly, and I'll be a master as soon as possible.
- I work alone.
- If you wish to speak to me, you can contact me on YouTube https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsAWrDo81Etz03lFPhIOKbQ, or you can join my Minecraft SMP Server ip is: DungeonCrawlSMP.aternos.me
